## Projects
### Emotion Detection From Facial Expressions  [project](https://github.com/ChinthaSrikar/Emotion_Recognition_From_Facial_Expressions)
Developed a **custom Five-CNN model** for real-time facial emotion detection using the **FER-2013 dataset**, achieving **64.1% accuracy**. Integrated **webcam** functionality for live detection and optimized the model with **Cross-Entropy Loss** and the **Adam optimizer** for improved performance.
- Technologies:Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- Pre-Trained Models:VGG11, VGG16, RESNET34
- Impact:Achieved 64.1% accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset, with real-time emotion detection capabilities.

### Cricket Matrix : A Database approach to Cricket Analysis
Developed a **PostgreSQL** based database to analyze player performance across various formats (ODI, Test, T20), enabling data-driven decisions for player selection and performance evaluation. Implemented indexing and optimization strategies to improve the databaseâ€™s scalability and query efficiency, supporting real-time analytics.
- Technologies:PostgreSQL, SQL, B-tree Indexing, Data Modeling
- MY Role:Sourced, preprocessed, and integrated metadata into the database. Oversaw the creation and population of essential tables and collaborated with the team to improve data performance.
- Impact:Optimized data integration for efficient analysis, providing real-time insights into cricket statistics for analysts and enthusiasts.
